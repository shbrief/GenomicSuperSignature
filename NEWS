CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.0
------------------------
    o [Bug Fix]
    - `PCAGenomicSignatures` construction function has a bug in its object 
    inheritence step, which is fixed now. 
    - `validate` function can perform better with scRNAseq data, because it now 
    uses `irlba` instead of `prcomp`, which significantly improves the speed.
    
     o [Major]
    - `rowNorm` function is deprecated.
    - Remove the `scale` argument of `validate` function.
    - Deprecate the `rowNorm` function.

     o [Minor]
    - Citation is added.  
    


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.0
------------------------
    o [Bug Fix]
    - `findStudiesInCluster`: single-element clusters return the correct
    study now, instead of `null`

    o [Major]
    - `findStudiesInCluster`: the output includes PC number of the participating
    study in the cluster and the variance explained by them. With `studyTitle=FALSE`,
    the output will be a data frame, not a character vector.
    - `subsetEnrichedPathways`: the new argument `include_nes` is added. If it
    is set to `TRUE`, the output will include NES from GSEA.
    - `getRAVInfo` and `getStudyInfo`: two new functions to extract basic
    metadata for RAVs and studies, respectively.
    - We characterize RAVs that are harder to interpret with the currently available
    information associated with them (more detail can be found bit.ly/RAVmodel_characterization).
    For the following functions, any output including those RAVs will have a
    defulat message: `meshTable`, `drawWordcloud`, `heatmapTable`, `validatedSignatures`.
    You can snooze this by setting `filterMessage = FALSE`
    - New required parameter `RAVmodel` for the following functions:
    `annotatePC`,`heatmapTable` and `validatedSignatures`.
    - New accessor `version` is available to check the version of RAVmodel
    - New function `availableRAVmodel` will output the different versions of 
    RAVmodels available for downloading now. 
    - `getModel` function now takes a new argument, `version`, to specify the 
    version of RAVmodel to download.

    o [Minor]
    - miniRAVmodel is updated



CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0
------------------------
    o [Bug Fix]
    - `n` argument of `annotatePC` was hard-coded. Now it can return
    different number of enriched pathways.
    - `abs` argument of `annotatePC` was fixed.
    - Fix wrongfully assigned variable within `plotAnnotatedPCA` function.

    o [Major]
    - `drawWordcloud` has a new argument `droplist`.
    - Argument name for `plotAnnotatedPCA` is changed from `PCs` to `PCnum`.
    - New argument `studyTitle` for `findStudiesInCluster` function.

    o [Minor]
    - Description of the package is updated.
    - If non-existing index is provided for any function, it will return with
    the error message.



CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------
    o Initial release of the 'GenomicSuperSignature' package
